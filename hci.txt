gulf of execution vs evaluation
The Gulf of Execution and the Gulf of Evaluation are two psychological theories that describe the difficulties people face when they are trying to accomplish a task using a computer or other technology.

The Gulf of Execution refers to the gap between the user's goals or intentions and the actions they must take to achieve those goals using a computer or other technology. For example, a user may have a goal of finding information about a particular topic, but may struggle with how to use the search engine effectively to accomplish that goal.

The Gulf of Evaluation, on the other hand, refers to the gap between the information provided by a computer or other technology and the user's understanding of that information. For example, a user may receive a complex graph or chart as the result of a query, but may have trouble interpreting what the graph represents and what it means.

Both the Gulf of Execution and the Gulf of Evaluation can lead to frustration and decreased satisfaction with technology. Designers of technology aim to minimize these gaps in order to create user-friendly and effective products.




The 5 Ds in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) refer to the five key elements of designing and evaluating human-centered technology:

Description: This is the stage where the problem or opportunity is identified and the design requirements are established. It includes defining the target audience, the goals and objectives of the design, and the constraints and limitations.

Design: In this stage, the design solution is created, including sketches, wireframes, and prototypes. The focus is on creating a design that meets the requirements established in the description stage and is user-centered, meaning it is designed with the needs and capabilities of the target audience in mind.

Development: This stage involves building the final product, including writing code, testing and debugging, and integrating components.

Deployment: This stage involves putting the product into use, which can involve distributing the product to users, training users, and providing support.

Evaluation: In this stage, the effectiveness of the product is evaluated through testing and feedback from users. This helps to identify areas for improvement and refine the product to better meet the needs of the target audience.



example of decide framework
Here is an example of using the DECIDE framework to design a new smartphone application:

Define: The problem is to create a new smartphone application to help people manage their daily tasks and to-do lists. The target audience is busy people who need help organizing their tasks and staying on top of their to-do list. The goals of the app include allowing users to easily add and manage tasks, prioritize tasks, and receive reminders to complete tasks. The constraints include limited development time and budget, and the requirement that the app be compatible with both iOS and Android operating systems.

Explore: The design team conducts user research to understand the needs and behaviors of the target audience. They also review existing task management apps to understand what features and functionality are already available in the market.

Create: Based on their research, the design team creates sketches and wireframes of the app interface and functionality. They also create a prototype to test the usability and functionality of the app.

Iterate: The design team tests the prototype with users and receives feedback on the app. Based on this feedback, they make improvements to the app, such as adding new features, improving the user interface, and fixing any bugs.

Implement: The final design is implemented by the development team, who write the code for the app and test it for compatibility with iOS and Android operating systems.

Evaluate: The app is released to the public and the design team receives feedback from users. Based on this feedback, they make further improvements to the app, such as adding new features or fixing any bugs. Over time, the design team continues to evaluate the app and make improvements to ensure it meets the needs of the target audience.

This example shows how the DECIDE framework can be used to design a new smartphone app in a structured and user-centered way. By following the framework, the design team can ensure that the app meets the needs of the target audience and provides a useful and usable solution for managing daily tasks.





usability testing
Usability testing is a method used to evaluate the ease of use and effectiveness of a product or system, such as a website, application, or physical device. The goal of usability testing is to identify any problems or issues with the product and to make recommendations for improvement.

Usability testing typically involves having real users perform specific tasks using the product, and observing and recording their interactions and behaviors. This data is then analyzed to identify any areas of difficulty or frustration, and to make recommendations for improvement.

Usability testing can be conducted at various stages of the design and development process, from early prototypes to finished products. It can be done in a laboratory setting, using specialized software, or in the field, with real users in real-world settings.

Usability testing is important because it provides valuable feedback from real users on the usability of a product. This feedback can help designers and developers make improvements to the product to ensure that it is easy and efficient to use, and meets the needs of its intended audience.

There are several methods of usability testing, including:

Lab-based testing: Participants are brought into a laboratory setting and asked to perform tasks on the product while being observed and recorded.

Remote testing: Participants perform tasks on the product remotely, while being observed and recorded over the internet.

Field testing: Participants use the product in their natural environment, while being observed and recorded.

User surveys: Participants are asked to complete a survey or questionnaire about their experience using the product.

Regardless of the method used, the goal of usability testing is to provide valuable feedback on the usability of the product, so that improvements can be made to enhance its effectiveness and user experience.





heuristic vs cognitive
Heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthrough are two methods used to evaluate the user experience and usability of products and systems. Although they share some similarities, they have distinct differences.

Heuristic evaluation is a method of evaluating the user interface of a product or system based on a set of established usability heuristics. Heuristics are general principles for designing user-friendly products and interfaces, and can include items such as consistency, visibility of system status, and error prevention. During a heuristic evaluation, a group of experts in human-computer interaction review the product and compare it to the established heuristics, identifying areas for improvement.

Cognitive walkthrough, on the other hand, is a method of evaluating the user experience by simulating the thought process of a user as they interact with a product or system. It involves evaluating a product or system by following a set of tasks and examining the user's experience at each step of the task. The goal is to identify any areas where the user might have trouble understanding the system or performing the task, and to make recommendations for improvement.

In summary, heuristic evaluation is a method of evaluating the user interface of a product or system based on established usability principles, while cognitive walkthrough is a method of evaluating the user experience by simulating the thought process of a user as they interact with a product or system. Both methods can provide valuable insights into the usability and user experience of a product, and can be used to make improvements to enhance the overall user experience.





neilson heuristic with example
Jakob Nielsen's heuristics are a set of 10 general principles for designing user-friendly and effective user interfaces. They are:

Visibility of system status: The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

Match between system and the real world: The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.

User control and freedom: Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.

Consistency and standards: Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.

Error prevention: Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

Recognition rather than recall: Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

Flexibility and efficiency of use: Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

Aesthetic and minimalist design: Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

Help and documentation: Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

An example of how these heuristics can be applied in practice is in the design of an e-commerce website. The website could ensure that the system status is always visible to the user by displaying the number of items in the user's shopping cart and providing clear notifications during the checkout process. The website could also follow the real-world language by using familiar terms such as "shopping cart" and "checkout" instead of technical terms. The website could provide users with clear "emergency exits" to cancel a purchase or go back to previous pages. The website could ensure consistency by using the same terminology and layout throughout the site. The website could prevent errors by checking for invalid input and clearly indicating required fields. The website could allow users to recognize information instead of having to recall it by prominently displaying important information such as the total cost of the purchase and shipping options. The website could also provide users with help and documentation, such as a frequently asked questions section or live chat support.





cognitive walkthrough example
A cognitive walkthrough is a method for evaluating the usability of a product or system by simulating the thought process of a user as they complete a task. Here's an example of how a cognitive walkthrough might be performed:

Identify the task: The first step is to identify the task that the user will be completing. For example, the task could be to purchase a product on an e-commerce website.

Identify the steps: The next step is to break down the task into a series of steps. For example, the steps to purchase a product on an e-commerce website might include finding the product, adding it to the cart, and checking out.

Evaluate each step: For each step, a team of experts will evaluate the user experience, considering the following questions:

Will the user know what to do next?
Will the user understand the information presented to them?
Will the user be able to complete the step successfully?
Make recommendations: Based on the evaluation, the team will make recommendations for improvement. For example, if the team determines that the user might have trouble finding the product, they might recommend making the search function more prominent or adding category filters.

Repeat the process: The cognitive walkthrough process should be repeated for each task that the user will be completing.

This example shows how a cognitive walkthrough can be used to evaluate the user experience of an e-commerce website. By simulating the thought process of a user, the walkthrough provides valuable insights into areas where the user might have trouble and makes recommendations for improvement.





example of usability testing
Usability testing is a method for evaluating the user experience of a product or system by having real users complete tasks and observing their behavior. Here's an example of how a usability test might be performed:

Recruit participants: The first step is to recruit participants who are representative of the target user group. Participants can be recruited through online platforms or by personal referral.

Prepare the task list: The next step is to prepare a list of tasks that the participants will be asked to complete. The tasks should be representative of the tasks that the target user group will be completing.

Set up the testing environment: The testing environment should be set up to simulate the real-world experience of using the product or system. This might involve using a computer or mobile device, or a physical prototype.

Conduct the test: During the test, each participant will be asked to complete the tasks while being observed by the testing team. The team will take notes on the participant's behavior and collect data on their success rate, completion time, and any errors they encounter.

Analyze the results: After the test, the team will analyze the results to identify areas of the user experience that need improvement. For example, if many participants had trouble completing a particular task, the team might conclude that the task flow needs to be re-designed.

Make recommendations: Based on the analysis, the team will make recommendations for improvement. For example, if the team determines that the navigation is confusing, they might recommend adding more clear labels or re-arranging the menu.

This example shows how a usability test can be used to evaluate the user experience of a product or system. By observing real users as they complete tasks, the test provides valuable insights into areas where the user might have trouble and makes recommendations for improvement.

goal-directed design model with example
The Goal-Directed Design model is a user-centered design approach that focuses on understanding the goals and tasks of the users in order to design a product that meets their needs effectively. The model consists of the following steps:

Understanding the user: The first step is to understand the user's needs, goals, and behaviors. This might involve conducting user research, such as surveys, interviews, or observation studies.

Defining user goals: Based on the understanding of the user, the next step is to define the user's goals. These goals should be specific, measurable, and aligned with the user's needs.

Defining tasks: The third step is to define the tasks that the user will need to complete in order to achieve their goals. These tasks should be aligned with the user's goals and should be realistic and achievable.

Designing the interface: The next step is to design the interface based on the tasks and goals defined in the previous steps. This might involve sketching wireframes or prototypes, or creating high-fidelity designs.

Evaluating the design: The final step is to evaluate the design by testing it with real users. This might involve conducting usability tests, user studies, or other forms of user research.

Here's an example of how the goal-directed design model might be applied in the design of a recipe app:

Understanding the user: The first step is to understand the user's needs, goals, and behaviors. For example, the research might show that the users are looking for a convenient way to find and save recipes, and that they often cook for their families and friends.

Defining user goals: Based on the understanding of the user, the next step is to define the user's goals. For example, the goals might be: to easily find and save new recipes, to easily access saved recipes, and to share recipes with friends and family.

Defining tasks: The third step is to define the tasks that the user will need to complete in order to achieve their goals. For example, the tasks might be: searching for recipes, saving recipes, accessing saved recipes, and sharing recipes.

Designing the interface: The next step is to design the interface based on the tasks and goals defined in the previous steps. For example, the design might include a search bar for finding recipes, a save button for saving recipes, and a list of saved recipes for easy access.

Evaluating the design: The final step is to evaluate the design by testing it with real users. For example, the team might conduct a usability test to see how well the users are able to find and save recipes, and to see if the interface is intuitive and easy to use.

By using the goal-directed design model, the recipe app design team can ensure that the product meets the needs of the users by focusing on their goals and tasks. The model provides a structured approach to user-centered design that can result in a more effective and satisfying product.
